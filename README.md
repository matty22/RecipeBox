# Recipe Box

The Recipe Box project is written in Angular and allows the user to add new recipes to their recipe box and adjust the name, ingredients, and instructions.

## To Use

To add a new recipe, click the '+' button above the list of recipes on the left. Enter info in the fields and hit 'Submit'. To edit or delete an existing recipe, click on its name in the recipe list on the left side and either change the values in the fields to edit or press the 'Delete' button under the recipe information fields.
